#Thread Demo

##Premise
A series of concurrent demos, to demonstrate simple, straight-forward concurrent ideas.

##QuickSort
Quicksort, except throw 2*N threads at the problem, where N is the number of elements in the collection you're sorting.

##Weird Dependencies
I got really used to being able to use Guava, so you will need to get Guava.
